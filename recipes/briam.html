    <h1>Briam (Greek Baked Zucchini and Potatoes)</h1>
    <img src="/images/briam.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Briam is a traditional Greek roasted vegetable dish with potatoes, zucchini, tomatoes, and red onions with lots of olive oil. It is a typical example of Greek cuisine where a few simple ingredients are turned into an utterly delicious dish with little effort. It can be served as a main course. With olive oil as the only source of fat it is a quintessential example of the Mediterranean diet, and it is vegan to boot. If preferred, serve with a hearty chunk of feta on the side.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 large zucchini, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 small red onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 ripe tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>Â½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread potatoes, zucchini, and red onions in a 9x13-inch baking dish, or preferably a larger one. Use 2 baking dishes if necessary. Cover with pureed tomatoes, olive oil, parsley. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Toss all ingredients together so that the vegetables are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, stirring after 1 hour, until vegetables are tender and moisture has evaporated, about 90 minutes. Cool slightly before serving, or serve at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>You can "puree" the tomato by cutting them in half and grating them on a large box grater, leaving the skin behind.</p>
    <p>Don't be afraid of salt and pepper with this dish. Be liberal for best results. Start out as you normally would, and you can always add more seasoning when you check after the 1-hour mark!</p>
